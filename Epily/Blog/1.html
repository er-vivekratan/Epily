    <h2>Understanding Epilepsy</h2>
    <p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain that can affect how a person feels or acts for a short time. Seizures can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Types of Seizures</h2>
    <p>There are several types of seizures, categorized into two main groups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focal Seizures:</strong> Originate in one area of the brain and can cause both motor and sensory symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Generalized Seizures:</strong> Affect both sides of the brain and can cause loss of consciousness, falls, or massive muscle spasms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of Epilepsy</h2>
    <p>The exact cause of epilepsy is often unknown, but it can be associated with several factors such as genetic influence, head trauma, brain conditions, infectious diseases, prenatal injury, and developmental disorders.</p>

    <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
    <p>Epilepsy treatment typically involves medication to control seizures. In some cases, surgery, dietary changes, or lifestyle modifications may also be recommended. It's important for individuals with epilepsy to work closely with their healthcare providers to find the most effective treatment plan.</p>
